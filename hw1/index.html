		<h1>CS 184 Homework 1 Write-Up</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<div>
		In this assignment, we first learned how to rasterize a single-color triangle without oversampling. Then, we learned the oversampled triangle rasterization and implementation of translate/scale/rotate transform. After that, we rasterize multi-color triangles with barycentric interpolation, and rasterize textured triangles with texture filtering and level sampling. Two basic methods are linear interpolation and nearest method.
		We also implement the extra credit for Task 1, optimizing the efficiency to rasterize a triangle using segment intersections instead of point-in-triangle tests.

		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		<h3>Algorithm Description:</h3> 
		<div>First, we can find out the bounding box of the triangle by find the minimum/maximum x,y values of the three given points of the triangle. Then, check each pixel $(x,y)$ in the bounding box whether the sample point $(x+0.5,y+0.5)$ is inside the triangle. If the sample point is inside the triangle, we fill the pixel with the given color of the triangle. 
		</div>
		<h3>Algorithm Effciency</h3>
		<div> Since we first find out the bounding box inside the viewplot. </div>
		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
		<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
		<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
		<h2>Task 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
