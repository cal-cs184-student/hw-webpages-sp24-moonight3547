<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<h3>Implementation Overview</h3>
<p>
In this assignment, we first learned how to rasterize a single-color triangle without supersampling. Then, we learned the supersampled triangle rasterization and implementation of translate/scale/rotate transform. After that, we rasterize multi-color triangles with barycentric interpolation, and rasterize textured triangles with texture filtering and level sampling. Two basic methods are linear interpolation and nearest method.
We also implement the extra credit for Task 1, optimizing the efficiency to rasterize a triangle using segment intersections instead of point-in-triangle tests. 
</p>
<h3>Framework Overview</h3>
<p>
As a whole, we've built the rasterization part in this assignment. 
In the framework, the DrawRend renderer will redraw the GUI window at a frequency or after some key input. 
When redrawing, the renderer will invoke the methods we implemented to rasterize all the points, lines, and triangles (triangulation is given in the framework). 
</p>
<h3>My Thoughts</h3>
<p>
I learned many interesting things when completing the assignment. I learned a framework to transform SVG objects into NDC and NDC into screen-space. In the framework, I implemented the details of rasterization using supersampling for antialiasing, bilinear interpolation and nearest method for texture sampling, mipmaping for level sampling. 
The assignment not only help me review these concepts but also give me an opportunity to understand how they work actually. Besides, I also gain experience in solving detailed problems like how to deal with the boundary of triangles and data out of range. Extra credits are greatly designed but I only solve that of Task 1 due to the time issue. 
But the efficiency improvement in triangle rasterization also help me practice a lot in algorithm designs and programming. 
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>
<h4 align="middle">Algorithm Description</h4> 
<p>First, we can find out the bounding box of the triangle by find the minimum/maximum x,y values of the three given points of the triangle. 
Then, check each pixel (x,y) in the bounding box whether the sample point (x+0.5,y+0.5) is inside the triangle. If the sample point is inside the triangle, we fill the pixel with the given color of the triangle. 
</p>
<h4 align="middle">Algorithm Effciency</h4>
<p> Since we first find out the bounding box inside the viewplot. We only check those pixels in the bounding box whether the sample point of the pixel is inside the triangle in O(1) time (constant time). Notice that the constant runtime of point-in-triangle test is large since it takes three line test and each includes a lot of calculation. Although this method takes a lot of time when the number of triangles is very large (e.g. svg/basic/test3.svg), the algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle since we ignore the part of triangle that outside the frame. 
</p>

<p>We can find the screenshot of drawing svg/basic/test4.svg without supersampling below. </p>

<h4 align="middle">Extra Credit</h4>
<p>The optimized algorithm is to calculate the intersection of the three edges of a triangle with the axis y equal to each possible value. All the pixels on the axis with x-value between the minimum x-value of intersection and the maximum x-value of intersection must be also inside the triangle since triangles are convex hulls. In this way, we don't need to calculate that much for point-in-triangle test and need to only fill the pixels in the triangle (about half the bounding box).

<p>We can use chrono::high_resolution_clock::now() to record the start time and end time of svg.draw() inside the redraw() function of DrawRend class. Then we output the time cost each time we redraw the viewer. The optimization is much more obvious for svg files with more triangles to rasterize. For example, the SVG file svg/basic/test3.svg has many triangles to rasterize and the original algorithm takes about 11 times more runtime than the optimized algorithm to redraw the viewer. The optimization has about 1000% improvement in execution time performance.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>
<h4 align="middle">Algorithm Description</h4>
In supersampling, we divide each pixel into smaller grids and select the centers of each grid as a sample point. The number of the grids is the sample rate. We take the mean value of the color value of the multiple sample points as the final image color at each pixel. This help us to reduce the large frequency changes in the corresponding frequency space of the image and reduce the jaggies. 

<h4 align="middle">Implementation Explanation</h4>
We implement supersampling by adding two loops within the iteration of each pixel to iterate all the sample points of the pixel. We also need to enlarge the size of sample buffer to be sample rate times the frame buffer size since the number of sample points for each pixel is the constant sample rate. We now check each sample point whether it is inside the triangle or not and fill the corresponding sample of the pixel with the color if the sample point is inside the triangle. In the end, we use resolve_to_framebuffer method to tranfer the sample_buffer into the final image by averaging all its sample points' color to get the color of a pixel. 

<h4 align="middle">Screenshot</h4>
<p>Below are the screenshots of images with sample rate from 1 to 16. The results of supersampling with larger sample rate is more smooth. The colors on the edge are gradually changing to reduce the jaggies and improve anti-aliasing power. It also reduce the high frequency changes in the frequency space of the image.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>
<h4 align="middle">Barycentric Coordinates Explanation</h4>
<p>Barycentric coordinates is a system of coordinates to linearly interpolate some value at any points inside a given triangle with given values at the three vertices. The value at each point is a linear combination of the values at the three vertices with the distance from the three edges as the coefficients. Barycentric coordinates help us to construct a smooth function of values inside the triangle area which can help us fill the the area with smooth colors or textures. 
</p>
<h4 align="middle">Triangle Example</h4>
<p>In the right example, we have a smoothly blended color regular triangle with three vertices of red, green, and blue. The color of the intermediate pixels inside the regular triangle are interpolated from these three vertices as a combination with different coefficients of these three colors. The coefficients depends on the distance away from each vertex. The farther the pixel is away from the red vertex, the less the color is red. The center of the regular triangle blends all the three colors. Red and green are blended into yellow, while red and blue are blended into purple.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>
<h4 align="middle">Pixel Sampling Explanation & Implementation</h4>
<p>Pixel sampling is the process of getting the color of a pixel in screen-space from an estimated position in the given texture image. First, we have an ideal corresponding position in the texture space for a pixel in screen-space estimated by barycentric coordinates system we discussed above. Then, we can implement pixel sampling by nearest sampling method or bilinear sampling method. These two pixel sampling methods help us get the color of a screen-space pixel from a corresponding point in the texture image. 
</p>
<p>The ideal point is estimated (interpolated) by barycentric coordinates. For nearest sampling, we select the color of the pixel in the texture image which is the nearest from the ideal point. For bilinear sampling method, we find the nearest four sampling point (u,v), (u,v+1), (u+1,v), (u+1,v+1) and use their color value to linearly interpolate the color value of the ideal point. The linear interpolation in bilinear sampling uses the lerp() function to find the interpolated value as a linear combination of the values of two closest integer points. 
</p>
<h4 align="middle">Two Methods Discussion</h4>
From the screenshots below, we can find that bilinear pixel sampling gives us more smoothly textured images. The image of nearest pixel sampling with sample rate 1 is pixelated and not smooth with many jaggies. The image of bilinear pixel sampling with sample rate 1 is much more smooth than the image of nearest pixel sampling with sample rate 1. Nearest pixel sampling with supersampling of sample rate 16 can also help make the image more smooth and reduce the jaggies and aliasing. Bilinear sampling with sample rate 16 is also smooth but a little blurred. Difference between the two pixel sampling methods: nearest pixel sampling can provides a clear but jaggy result since it only select the nearest pixel, while bilinear pixel sampling provides a smooth but a little blurred since it combines multiple surrounding pixels.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
<h4 align="middle">Level Sampling Explanation & Implementation</h4>
Level sampling is the process to find the appropriate mipmap level to use in texture sampling. We have three methods to select the level for sampling: level zero, nearest sampling, linear sampling. Level zero sampling is the easiest. Level zero sampling just sample each pixels in the mipmap of level 0 with the highest resolution. We implement this part by first estimating the level with Texture::get_level() function and then sampling the pixel with Texture::sample() function. To get the appropriate level, we take the derivative of u and v with respect to x and y with increment 1's. Here, we use Barycentric coordinates to get the corresponding value in uv space. The gradients help us see how the space stretched or compressed from screen-space to texture space. The norm of the gradient help us determine the mipmap level we need by taking the log base 2 to the norm of gradient. The nearest level sampling will round the idea level to the nearest mipmap level. The linear level sampling will interpolate between the two closest mipmap levels (with sample rate equal to a power of two), i.e. take the floor and ceiling value of the ideal level. Linear level sampling will calculate the pixel sampling result in these two levels and linearly interpolate the color value at the ideal level. 

<h4 align="middle">Tradeoff</h4>
<p>Consider the tradeoffs between pixel sampling, level sampling, and the number of samples per pixel in terms of speed, memory usage, and anti-aliasing power. 
</p>
<p>Speed: Nearest pixel sampling can be relatively faster compared to bilinear sampling and other techniques since it samples each pixel individually without considering neighboring pixels. But bilinear sampling may take more time compared to linear level sampling since bilinear sampling use four sample points while linear level sampling only use two. Involving sampling pixels at different levels, level sampling generally takes more time compared with pixel sampling. Supersampling with multiple samples per pixel must be slowest since it requires at least $4$ sample points and sometimes needs about $16$ sample points to have good performance. 
</p>
<p>Memory usage: Pixel sampling use the the least memory since it only needs to store information about each pixel being sampled. Level sampling use more memory space since it need to store information at multiple levels of mipmapping. Supersampling at high sample counts takes the largest memory space since it need to store all the sample results for each pixel. The memory usage is linearly increasing with the number of samples per pixel. 
</p>
<p>Anti-aliasing Power: Pixel sampling may not provide strong anti-aliasing effect, especially nearest pixel sampling. Nearest pixel sampling gives pixelated and jaggy results and has no anti-aliasing power. Bilinear pixel sampling provides a more smooth result and help anti-aliasing. Considering neighbor pixels at different levels, level sampling can provide better anti-aliasing effects compared with pixel sampling. Supersampling with multiple samples per pixel can greatly improves anti-aliasing by reducing noise and aliasing artifacts. 
</p>
<p>In summary, the choice of sampling technique depends on the specific requirements of the rendering/rasterization/texturing task, including factors like speed, memory usage and anti-aliasing power. Pixel sampling has fast speed and small memory usage but is not that good at anti-aliasing. Level sampling provides a moderate choice between the balance of speed, memory and anti-aliasing power. Supersampling with multiple samples per pixel can greatly improve anti-aliasing power but takes much more time and memory.
